# Getting More Than Three Colors
As shrouds are limited to using the three colors of their block (`fillColor`, `fillColor1`, and `lineColor`), they can usually only have three colors, but there are ways to get around the limitations.
## Never Firing Launchables
A [never firing launcher](./always_and_never_firing_weapons.md#never-fire-weapons), either turreted or non-turreted, can hold a launchable that can have its own three colors and its own shroud.
## Overlaying Transparent Shrouds
As overlayed transparent shrouds merge their colors, more than 3 colors can be created. This effect is of course limited, but it is useful for creating gradients.
