# Reassembly Modding by Example

Reassembly modding is fun. This resource has three goals:
 - To be what the average modder constantly checks to get field names correct,
 - To document more obscure parts of Reassembly modding (frags, shrouds, jank, etc.),
 - And to have some possibly useful advice on improvement and productivity when modding Reassembly.
