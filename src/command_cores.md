# Command Cores

```lua
{17000
    features=COMMAND
}
```

Command cores commonly have either the `REGROWER` or the `ASSEMBLER` features.

`REGROWER` allows the ship to be able to regenerate missing parts.

`ASSEMBLER` is the same as `REGROWER`, but also allows ships to reassembly themselves using parts from debris.
