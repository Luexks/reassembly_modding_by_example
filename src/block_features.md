# Block Features

The use of block features are how different types of blocks are created.

Say you want a generator, you would use `features=GENERATOR`.
Say you want a generator that also produced R. To do this you would add a delimiting pipe `|` character between the word `GENERATOR` and `PHOTOSYNTH`, giving you `features=GENERATOR|PHOTOSYNTH`.

Although there are exceptions, most block types are defined by either one or multiple feature flags. Features are what make Reassembly modding versatile.
